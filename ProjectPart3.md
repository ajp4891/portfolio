--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 1:
While working on part 1, the story was revolving around Netflix and how it has dominated the market.

### Part 2: 
In Part 2, main focus was on the sketches completed from Part 1, gathering user research and feedback on the story around Netflix.

### Summary Part 3:
The majority of the story is new content compared to what was worked on in Parts 1 and 2. Part 1 and Part 2 data research, on the other hand, provided me with a more accurate version of the story I was trying to paint. Please find further insights below, including a clear rundown of how the main idea was constructed.


### Audience:

Each home, particularly American families, is the target audience for "The Digital Domination." This page can also be used as a resource for new businesses entering the market. This article explains why it's critical to understand who will dominate the Entertainment/Video/Cable/Streaming industry.

According to data, people in the United States spend an average of 6-7 hours per day watching video content on various devices (such as mobile phones, televisions, and computers) and platforms (such as Instagram, Tok-tok, Netflix, or Cables etc.). We spend a significant amount of time watching video content, thus it is critical that we spend that time watching high-quality content rather than squandering it on low-quality stuff.

### Thought process while building up the story:
In this article, the storyline is demonstrated by first establishing why it is necessary for the audience to know who will dominate the entertainment industry. Second, showing market potential in order to fully understand why more companies are expected to enter or where the industry will stand in the following five years. This will also help people in visualizing the existing market, which generates roughly $24 billion in revenue, as well as the forecasted market, which has the potential to nearly double, i.e. $42 billion, and the industry's current and future scenarios.

Next, I wanted to highlight where traditional cable television fits into this new growing and digital industry, which is dominated in terms of revenue by internet platforms (mostly streaming platforms like Netflix). Why are cable TV subscriptions declining and the new trend, #CutTheCord, gaining traction? Cord cutters are primarily abandoning their cable television subscriptions due to the cost of these new evolving streaming platforms, on-demand content control, flexibility and portability, and the getting rid of channel bundling, which forces customers to pay extra for channels they are not even watching.

Furthermore, I wanted to highlight how, in the United States, Netflix alone is capturing a market similar to the top 14 cable service providers. This demonstrates the growing popularity of online streaming platforms. Customers want not only choices, but also a cheaper and higher-quality cable television alternatives where they can choose whatever content they want to watch rather than being compelled to watch specified content at a specific time with frequent advertising in between. This was demonstrated by first introducing Netflix's history in my story, followed by its popularity over time (as determined by the number of subscribers). In addition, it shows the annual retention % of their subscriber base, which is extremely high when compared to competitors.

Finally, presenting the current market situation, the Streaming War, in which dozens of platforms compete in the same sector. Where each production, such as Disney, Paramount, HBO, and others, pulls content from many networks and publishes it on their own Where each production, such as Disney, Paramount, HBO, and others, pulls content from many networks and publishes it on their own platform.

The size of the library and the percentage of users streaming - suggests users an idea of which platform is the most popular. Furthermore, providing statistics on the most popular material in several categories such as TV Shows, Movies, and Originals helps to paint a clear image of the top seller. Although dominance is not the only conclusion that can be drawn from these statistics, it does demonstrate how the number of items in the library and the number of views - lead to the quality of the content in the library for that platform. The quality of the platform is further defined by the awards it receives for its original content. (Given an example of Netflix’s number of nominations and wins in Emmy Awards)

Furthermore, displaying data on spending on original content reveals how much each platform is willing to lead this content war, as well as how each platform will define quality, uniqueness, versatility, or all in each piece of content they create or acquire in order to grow their subscriber base and stay competitive.

While providing background on Netflix, it is important for the audience to understand how other companies in the market are performing and their strategies to compete with Netflix. Here, Disney+, which has recently gained a lot of attention due to their massive budget (due to their earlier presence and experience in the cable television industry) and the high quality of their content. In the near future, it is believed that Disney would emerge as a challenger for Netflix in the Streaming war. It's remarkable that Disney+ was able to obtain 100+ million subscribers in less than 16 months, given the fact that Netflix had been working on it for nearly 18 years.

As a result of this article, readers will be able to determine which platform is the best or most likely to dominate the market in the near future, and where they should invest their money rather than passively watching random contents that may or may not be worth their time, money, and effort. This could mean ditching cable and switching to online streaming services like Netflix and Disney+.

### Behind the scene
Until I submitted part 2, the above story and direction were a bit unclear. Finding a proper story in this sector has been extremely stressful and time consuming for me. I had limited data, or could only find a portion of the facts, to construct a storyline around any single aspect of the current story. I had to blend numerous short stories to generate a bigger picture after struggling to ensure a good dataset to complete the entire story. This was extremely difficult to see at the time I was working on Part 2, and as a result, all the work completed after Part 2 was almost brand new.

After deciding to show who dominates this market, how this Streaming market evolved, and how it affects our audience in their day-to-day lives for the next few years, I scrapped the idea of showing only NETFLIX's view, history, and market presence. Instead, I tried to show who dominates this market, how this Streaming market evolved, and how it affects our audience in their day-to-day lives for the next few years. After further investigation and a few days of back-to-back research, I discovered some statistics that helped me strengthen the narrative, such as the fact that the majority of the top 10 movies/tv episodes seen online are from Netflix. Netflix accounts for around a quarter of all the streaming internet traffic. Also, how Netflix has a 35 percent share of content views among video streaming services, and so on.

The story was still all over the place at this point, and even with the additional facts and data I gathered, it was challenging to get the story straight. I began by working in sections. I started by constructing the structure of the story first. (i.e. rework of Project Part 1, but with the new storyline).

##### Below is the initial draft of the Structure of the new story:
- Title: The Digital Domination - Your go-to video streaming platform in 2024 (/// The next future)
- 1 How important is content in the average daily life.
(Food, Clothing, Shelter. and Video Binging?)
- 2 (Optional) Market Establishment - Is the future really here?
(Revenue Projection) 
//// (Laying out the groundwork - show number of subscribers, spending, profits)  (scraped)
- 3 - End of Cord?
cable tv vs streaming, current market share, reasons of cutting the cord

- 4 - Netflix - Winner!! Best is yet to come.
History, Subscribers, retention
Budget, content  (moved to streaming war),
Amount, streaming  (scraped)

- 5 - Streaming Wars!!!
Library Size, Before After
  - Cost, Quality Content, Spends, Revenue, Subscribers

---> Call to action: Which subscriptions gives you best...?
you can’t avoid video platforms, you almost spend one fourth of our life on video content, why not invest smartly, cheap and on quality media. (Paraphrased in the final story)
---> Audience: General Public, families

#### Rework of Part I and Part II for completing the new story in part III
In the final project, I used certain sketches from Part 1 to develop new viz to support the new story, such as annual Netflix subscribers, Total Usage of TV Screen Time in the US (Cable vs. Streaming vs. Others), and data from other charts. First, I looked up data on Netflix's competitors and dug deeper into the Streaming Wars. Streaming wars was my second draft for the final project, with Netflix being the first. At this point, I began focusing solely on the Streaming Wars, spending days searching for data and designing a viz at random in order to build the story line. Unfortunately, after days of work, I had to scrap this idea as well because it lacked a strong call to action. In this category, I learned it's tough to build a compelling call to action.

After doing further study on the subject of streaming wars, I had an epiphany when I asked myself why I would be so concerned about who would win the streaming wars. I began my investigation into the data on how users spend their daily time. The actual results surprised me, and it made me realize that I, too, am one of those users that spends hours and hours watching these shows and movies. This was a signal to me that I needed to improve my story and provide a compelling call to action.

I began by drawing rough sketches and referring to numbers, which I showed to a few friends, getting an idea, and asking if the story made sense and had a better connection to every person's daily life. I received a positive response, and I chose to move in this direction. 

Following the formation of a draft-story in accordance with the above revised structure, I continued my user research by asking same friends (with whom I had previously consulted for the user research), if they could tell me about their understanding of the viz without me having to explain it to them. They gave me comments,  and some of those important feedbacks are as followed:

-They advised me to use a stacked bar chart instead of two grouped bar charts for a Daily usage time of a person in US. This not only distinguishes time spent on "Streaming" from time spent on "Other", but it also creates a visual picture of how much it represents altogether.
- I can scrape Netflix's income graph because the rise of subscribers supports the point I was trying to illustrate, viz, Netflix's dominance in the streaming sector.
- They also proposed using content as a supporting point in the story when audience understands Quality of content when combined with % of video streaming of each platform daily. (For example, the fact that Netflix consumes 35% of video streaming bandwidth and has a content library of over 5000 titles indicates that Netflix offers high-quality material, and thus customers spend more time on it.) Furthermore, retention data was intended to be removed from the main story originally, but friends' comment suggests that it, coupled with the previous two data (Bandwidth and Library), significantly supports the case for the quality.

When looking at the facts holistically and in the sequence of a story conveyed to allow audience pick which platform is their next choice for investment, not only of money but also of one-third time their remaining life that they spend on videos, the call to action is evident for the audience.
