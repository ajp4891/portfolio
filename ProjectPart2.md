# Project Part 2

### User Research and feedback

- When asked 3 different people 
- Q1 - what they understood from the chart, what kind of story am I trying to convey here? s1 and s2 replied that I am trying to convey the story of Netflix, possibly its market value and its position against rivals. While s3 tends to feel it is regarding the streaming platform and its war, showing Netflix as a winner, survivor. 
- Q 2 – What do you feel it is missing in these graphs, that I could add/show to improve effectiveness?
	S3 – Could add more data regarding other streaming services to present comparison of similar data points. For e.g., show subscribers of other platforms compared to Netflix on a timeline (if possible), or show shares of each rival platforms and Netflix for comparisons (e.g. Bar chart of each platforms with their number of subscribers). Can also show the streaming market and each platform’s market involvement/share.

- Q 3 – What are the pointers in these visualizations I could improve to convey much accurately?
