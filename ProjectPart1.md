### Data : 
Below are the data that would be used to form the project. 1st URL of Drive.google.com is a collection of all the data from subsequent URL. I will be using the file below to build my story around.

Some of the below source sites have raw data while some have tabular data. Both are parsed and will be used. Some will be clubbed with other tables to form a meaningful comparisons.
