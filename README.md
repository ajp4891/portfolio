# Telling-the-Stories-With-Data

## About me
Hi, I am Ajay Patel (He/Him/His). Currently I am a graduate student at CMU. I am here to understand the way data can be represented and communicated better with an impact in a simpler way, so that even a common person can understand and relate.

## What I hope to learn
- Controlling the use of colors, make it more impactful.
- Graphical Presentation of the data
- Simplicity and the way to convey stories through the data visulization
