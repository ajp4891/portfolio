# Critique By Design:

## Introduction:
After going through 40-50 visulizations online, and with some really beautiful and well structured charts that are having proper dataset TO some charts with many bad elements that could have been imporved but have no dataset TO some good data which doesnt have any charts online, I had shortlisted a few viz to critique and redesign. After failing to recreate the expected visualization based on the correction/critique/feedback for 4 of the other vizulization, below viz is what I have selected finally to critique. Using my experience from the other 4 (partially completed) viz, I understood the changes that this viz requires. Additionally I have found more data in a different spreadsheet online for the same topic to add more weightage to this chart. The original chart shows only average US differences while I have added further more regions, having Most and Least Cost Counties. I have additionally changed Colors to show more impact on the numbers.

### Step 1: Find a Data Visualization (with data you can use!)

I Selected the below visualization that was originally posted on the Twitter and could be improved. I searched for further data to look for further infomration to add to the story. I found the original source KFF which had further data but distributed amongst different data sources/topics. I collected those to add into the understanding of the user and give a broader picture. Before selecting the below one, I had identified and worked on 4 other viz with larger dataset. While other 4 had many elements to work on and make it better, I found this viz to be simpler and could be improved if more data is to be added to the chart. This just gives a simple idea but mainly for the audience with some understanding in the field, however it can be elaborated and made further simpler for novice who would like to undestand how they are affected due AHCA change in 2020. What are their plans for future, and how it could have benefitted your or not.

### Step 2: Critique the Visualization
The visulization is quite straightforward giving information in the sleek design. Provides appropriate number dimensions for conveying the message, e.g. age, salaries and difference of ACA and AHCA i.e the impact of ACHA. 

It has one x-axis that has the entire story. This chart is trying to tell 3 different perspective for the audience, one with specific age, one who is in specific salary range, and the last one is for overall picture of US average (all data combined). This x-axis also gives a feel of Timeline as there is not Y-axis drawn, in the first eyeing. Additonally, the X-axis has two dimensions overlapped, this could be segregated in X and Y axes combination.

Even though this viz is simple, it lacks many elements to it which could have improved viz's value. This Viz would only attract those audience who has prior understaning in the field as this doesnt give much details about waht is the ratio of the difference, whether the differnce is minor, major or neglible. Neither it mentions for which region, and whether if its a difference of an average or the sum.

Colors are also minimal, which is good, however could be improved by assigning the gradient of colors to show the impact visually for the audience with a brief look, and attract the affected part of the viz. 

### Step 3: Wireframe a Solution

### Step 4: Test the Solution

### Step 5: Build Your Solution
